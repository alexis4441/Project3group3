# Project3group3
Project Overview:
  This project is focused on wildfire data between the years 2012-2022. The focus of the project is centralized around three questions: how much area is burnt per week and by country, the share of total land area burnt, years, and the type of land burnt most each years.

Instructions:
Libraries needed to download to run the code- folium, geopy, and dash.
Visualization 1 (bubble chart)- select the dropdown bar to select different regions/countries to see total land area burnt by wildfires each year.
Visualization 2 (map)- toggle with the three different dropdown bars to to see visually on a map wildfires by country per specific weeks of the year throughout the years 2012-2022. 


Ethical Conciderations:
  The ethical considerations used in this project revolve around utilizing this information in a safe way both for individuals and the environment. Some of this information obtained from this project can used to harm people or property, but the main goal of this presentation is for educational purposes. Additionally, we can use this data to implement provisions when it comes to fire safety.

Notes*
  In the data file, the column name was changed from entity to country, but for the bubble chart we had to keep the column as entity instead. Additionally, some of the data files has information from other years, but they were not complete. As a result, we had to remove some columns so that what is left is data from 2012-2022.
